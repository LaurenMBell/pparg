This is essentially my lab notebook haha. For more notes/supplementary stuff, 
check out the 'flix' folder for pics of my whiteboard/notebook as I designed
this project!

- Initialized GitHub repo with README and worked on the first step of the project: 
    data cleaning! I ended up altering my original plan of just using IC50 data, 
    since there are nearly twice as many observations for EC50 data and I want to 
    use both lol. This changed my design, as the ML pipeline will now need 2 models: 
    one for the antagonists (using the IC50 data) and one for the agonists (using 
    the EC50 data). 
- Note for later, there are 3779 compounds in the EC50 dataset and 1790 in the IC50 post 
    filtering for pChEMBL >= 5! I looked it up and that seems like fine numbers for 
    training a model on, but its good to keep in mind. 
- I filtered to pChEMBL >= 5, which is equal to <10 uM, which is generally the threshold
    for active compounds, but I want to look into more in the future. 
- Made some headway on feature selection (molecular weight, lipophilicity, # of H-bond acceptors, 
    # of H-bond donors) and converting the SMILES codes to those values using RDKit. 
- Watched this really helpful youtube vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z9XM9xamDU
- Started exploratory data analysis and foudn that I really shouldve done that before filtering 
    all the inactives lol
- Made some changes to data design and started making the model with this:

- Cleaned up model output (mostly for my own sake) and finished the tutorial! I tried 
    optimizing the hyperparameters

Before optimizing hyperparameters via RandomSearchCV: 
Model accuracy: 0.9479553903345725

For COc1ccc([C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO)cc1OC:

Molecular weight: 228.244
Number of H-bond Acceptors: 5
Number of H-bond Donors: 3
Lipophilicty (LogP): 0.09
-------------------------------
Activity Prediction: inactive
Probability: 0.82

After optimizing parameters:
Model accuracy: 0.9368029739776952

For COc1ccc([C@@H](O)[C@H](O)CO)cc1OC:

Molecular weight: 228.244
Number of H-bond Acceptors: 5
Number of H-bond Donors: 3
Lipophilicty (LogP): 0.09
-------------------------------
Activity Prediction: inactive
Probability: 0.9387955182072828

- Found that the best hyper parameters were {'max_depth': 6, 'n_estimators': 304}
- Finished the activity prediction part!! Time for Alphafold and molecular docking!!
- Chat I lied :C I messed up :C I have no way to differentiate between inhibitors or activators 
    in the pipeline unless the user explicitly says :C it's research time :C
- I think that for now I'm just going to go off model hits and update it later if needs be. 
    Like, if a given code comes up active in one and inactive in the other, then I'll just 
    assume, yk. 
use cases: 
ag | ant | =
+  | -   | ag
-  | +   | ant
-  | -   | inactive
+  | +   | mixed activity (who knows lol thats for me to worry about later)

- thinking about adding Lipinksi rule of 5 compliance to the data IDK if that would be interesting 
or not
- Decided that I will use P37231 (UniProt ID) as the representative structure of PPARG, 
    from the Protein Data Bank in Europe: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3e00/protein/2
    They use it as the representative structure because it is the "PDB chain 
    with highest data quality, coverage and best resolution"
- I've given up on the README and will just rewrite it at the end ngl 
- NOTE FOR LATER: AUTODOCKING TUTORIAL CITATION: 
Forli, S., Huey, R., Pique, M. E., Sanner, M. F., Goodsell, D. S., & Olson, A. J. (2016).
Computational proteinâ€“ligand docking and virtual drug screening with the AutoDock suite. Nature protocols, 11(5), 905-919.
- Planning out the final report: 
    - both models evaluation statistics 
    - structural and activity predictions 
    - pics of structure, docking, and diagram of logic 
    - does this predicted activator interact with regions that are important for coactivator recruitment? 
    - does this predicted inhibitor interfere with the regions that stabilize the active conformation
